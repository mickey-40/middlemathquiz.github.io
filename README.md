Project Description
My app is called Middle Math Trivia Game. It is an app for players who want to challenge their middle school math skills. It can be played solo and is a challenge to get the highest score. The score will be taken automatically and the longer the player takes to answer the lower the score will be. The solo player will answer 10 questions, display the current score while playing the game, and when the game ends show where the player places within the top 10.
